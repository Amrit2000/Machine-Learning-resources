# Description



A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies data by finding an optimal line 
or hyperplane that maximizes the distance between each class in an N-dimensional space.

They distinguish between two classes by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the closest data 
points of opposite classes. The number of features in the input data determine if the hyperplane is a line in a 2-D space 
or a plane in a n-dimensional space. Since multiple hyperplanes can be found to differentiate classes, maximizing the margin 
between points enables the algorithm to find the best decision boundary between classes. This, in turn, enables it to 
generalize well to new data and make accurate classification predictions. The lines that are adjacent to the optimal hyperplane
are known as support vectors as these vectors run through the data points that determine the maximal margin.
